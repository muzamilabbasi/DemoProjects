ommand line only - no GUI wanted or needed. Please don't do a GUI - Only Bash

Must run on linux at the command line, accepting a command line parameter and returning the data desired - Bash file can run anywhere


Any language you choose, but think about what SRE's use - that's your audience - Simple Bash and Curl and jq

You may not use any libraries that implement this API for you Not using any python libraries


The challenge is to do a simple REST implementation of this protocol yourself Simple Rest using curl

Consider security in your solution, even if it's just discussing it in your README 


Program must accept a command line parameter of a MAC address - DONE
Program must query the API for a result over the network - DONE


Program must output the Company Name associated with that MAC address in some useful way to the user at the command line - WRITE IS OUT IN A FILE DONE 



Program must be dockerized (i.e. the work to make it into a docker container must be present)
All source code for the program and Docker file must be in a git repository
The Git repository must be in your github.com account and publicly accessible (github.com is free for public repos)

You should assume we will clone your repo and test it personally

You should "think unix philosophy" and consider how this kind of tool would build your toolbox

Provide some kind of README explaining your work and how others would use it

This is an example of your work. Don't make a career out of it but take the time to do a decent job
